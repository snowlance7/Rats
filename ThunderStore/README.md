# Rats Mod

## Behavior



## Planned features

- Rat king
- Diseased rats that can make the player get sick, lowering stamina and making them cough, etc
- Rallying: If a player or enemies threat level is high enough, a rat will return to the nest and rally any nearby rats to form a kill squad to hunt down their target
- Outside rats: Chance for the rat nest to spawn outside with a different model (a burrow or debree)
- More rat types: Maybe different rat types like brute rat with more hp and mother rat that spawns more rats
- Better models and textures
- Rat items like cheese to lure them away, rat traps or nailgun turret
- Optimizations so there can be more rats with less performance issues if possible
- More configs for performance
