Ideas for controlling rat population:
- A expensive ship command or one time purchase that makes all steam valves go off at once and dispense poisonous gas for a time
- A portable gas dispensor that sprays poisonous gas around an area and slowly spreads out
- Single rat traps for only 1 credit
- Expensive nail gun turret buyable in shop that kills rats
- Glue Rat Traps (sellable?)
- Poison canister (pour it down sewer grates to stop spawning regardless of wether the grate is closed or not)
- Cats!
